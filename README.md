# Floppy Bird

Floppy bird is a variation of the classic mobile game "Flappy Bird" made in pygame.

The difference between the two games only involves the design of the player: playing with the word "flappy", the player is not anymore a bird but a flying "floppy" disk and therefore the game is named "Floppy bird" and not "Flappy bird". 

Following the general theme of the game, the obstacles are trasformed, from the tubes of the original version, into usb emphasizing the generational distance between floppy disk and usb.

## How to play Floppy Bird

The game is actually available only on desktop and to run it the computer needs to have installed both [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Pygame 2.1.2](https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml). After installed the dependencies and cloned the repository, the only thing to do to run the game is to run the [main.py](https://github.com/lucaincarnato/floppy-bird/blob/main/src/main.py) file.

Once the file is run it will appear the game's window. The run starts once hit the spacebar, as suggested by the main page, and pressing the same key in the run makes the floppy jump.
